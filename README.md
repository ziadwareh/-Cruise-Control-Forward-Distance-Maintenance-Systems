# -Cruise-Control-Forward-Distance-Maintenance-Systems
In this project we designed our vehicle on Fusion 360. We then implemented two embedded systems on it. The first was a cruise control system while the other was a forward distance maintainance system. Both systems' controllers were designed on MATLAB. The parameters of the vehicle were expiramentally obtained.
